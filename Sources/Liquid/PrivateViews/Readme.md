#  PrivateViews
The PrivateViews folder contains underlying SwiftUI Shapes and Views that represent Liquid objects. For each type of Liquid object, there is a file containing a Shape struct and a file with the View struct. The Shape structs are responsible for calling processing functions to render a path. The View structs wrap the shapes and control the animatable data.
